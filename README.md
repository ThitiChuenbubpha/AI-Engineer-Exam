# AI Engineer Exam: Practical Assessment

## 🎯 Objective
This exam is designed to assess your practical skills in designing and developing AI systems. You are required to use the provided datasets to build innovative solutions using both **Traditional Machine Learning** and **Generative AI (LLMs)** technologies.

---

## 📂 Data Resources
You are provided with the following data sources:

### 📦 Product Data
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/product_details` | 100 PDF files with detailed product specifications and descriptions |
| `/product_images` | Corresponding product images |
| `/sqlite_db` | SQLite database (`data.db`) with relational data (products, sales, inventory, etc.) |

### 💰 Loan Data (NEW)
| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/Loan_data/train.csv` | Training dataset (~43MB) with historical loan records including default labels |
| `/Loan_data/test.csv` | Test dataset (~20MB) for prediction (no default labels) |
| `/Loan_data/loan_database.sqlite` | Normalized SQLite database (~118MB) with properly structured schema |
| `/Loan_data/db_schema.md` | Complete database schema documentation with ER diagram |
| `/Loan_data/Data Dictionary.xlsx` | Data dictionary explaining all variables |

#### Loan Database Schema Overview
```
loans (main) ─┬─ credit_scores (bureau score)
              ├─ primary_accounts (borrower's loans)
              ├─ secondary_accounts (guarantor's loans)
              ├─ account_history (credit history)
              └─ lookup tables (states, branches, suppliers, manufacturers, risk_categories)
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `loan_database.sqlite` for SQL-based analysis or raw CSV files for direct data manipulation.
